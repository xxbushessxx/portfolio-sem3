## Info

For this project I have used Next.JS which is framework enabling React applications with server-side rendering and static-websites. I found it the best framework I can use because it made it easy to navigate between components and it is fast!

For the design I've used Tailwind which is a CSS framework. Basically what Tailwind is - set of classes. With Tailwind the design is easy to build and customize.

I have also used SCSS which let me use variables and shorten the code.
